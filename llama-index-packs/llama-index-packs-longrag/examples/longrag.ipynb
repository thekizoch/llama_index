    "# LongRAG example\n",
    "\n",
    "This LlamaPack implements LongRAG based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15319).\n",
    "\n",
    "LongRAG retrieves large tokens at a time, with each retrieval unit being ~6k tokens long, consisting of entire documents or groups of documents. This contrasts the short retrieval units (100 word passages) of traditional RAG. LongRAG is advantageous because results can be achieved using only the top 4-8 retrieval units, and long-context LLMs can better understand the context of the documents because long retrieval units preserve their semantic integrity."

Encouraging the youth-driven food boom is essential, as it attracts young people, particularly those aged 25 to 29, who are crucial for startups. The city should also focus on maintaining its affordable yet desirable housing, preserving historic buildings, and enhancing its bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure to make it more appealing to young professionals. Additionally, leveraging Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) research capabilities and fostering a socially liberal culture that tolerates strangeness can further support the startup ecosystem. Although Pittsburgh currently lacks a robust investor community, the decreasing cost of starting startups and alternative funding sources like Kickstarter and Y Combinator can mitigate this challenge over time.\n",
